# Step-by-step FSM Design Guide

---

### Step 1: Define the problem and the FSM behavior

* Clearly understand what you want to control with the FSM
* Identify the inputs and outputs
* List all possible states the system can be in

---

### Step 2: Define the States

* Write down all possible states of the system
* Assign each state a name and a unique code (using `parameter` or `enum` in Verilog)

---

### Step 3: Specify Inputs and Outputs

* Identify the inputs that cause state transitions
* Define the outputs generated by the FSM

---

### Step 4: Draw the State Diagram or State Table

* For each state, define which next state to go to based on inputs
* Specify outputs for each state (Moore FSM) or outputs based on state and input (Mealy FSM)

---

### Step 5: Decide the FSM Type

* Moore FSM: outputs depend only on the current state
* Mealy FSM: outputs depend on the current state and inputs

---

### Step 6: Implement the FSM in Code (e.g., Verilog)

* Define states using `parameter` or `enum`
* Create registers for current state and next state
* **Sequential block:** Update current state at clock edge
* **Combinational block:** Calculate next state from current state and inputs
* **Output block:** Generate outputs based on state (Moore) or state and inputs (Mealy)

---

### Step 7: Write a Testbench

* Apply inputs with proper timing to the FSM
* Monitor outputs and state transitions
* Verify correct behavior in all scenarios

---

### Step 8: Simulate and Debug

* Run simulations (using ModelSim, Vivado Simulator, etc.)
* Check output waveforms and state changes
* Fix any bugs found

---

### Step 9: Synthesize and Implement in Hardware (optional)

* Deploy your FSM design on FPGA or ASIC
* Test the real hardware behavior

---

## Important tip:

Always keep your FSM design clean and well-structured to avoid errors and make it easy to understand.
